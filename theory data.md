* **CPM:** A project management technique that determines the longest sequence of activities that must be completed on time for the entire project to be completed on schedule.
* **Critical Path:** The sequence of tasks that has no "float" or "slack" (i.e., zero flexibility in their schedule). Any delay on the critical path will delay the entire project.

### üé≤ Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

* **PERT:** A project management technique used to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a project, particularly when the activity times are uncertain.
* Uses a probabilistic approach to estimate activity durations (optimistic, pessimistic, most likely times) to calculate expected project completion time and associated risks.

    * **Microsoft Project:** Comprehensive project management software for planning, scheduling, resource management, and tracking.
    * **Open Source Tools:** Alternatives like ProjectLibre, GanttProject, Trello, Jira (commercial, but widely used for agile).

### üåü Importance of Project Quality Management

* Ensuring that the project and its deliverables meet defined quality standards and satisfy stakeholder needs.
* **Planning Quality Management:** Identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and its deliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance.
* **Performing Quality Assurance:** Auditing the project's quality requirements and the results from quality control measurements to ensure appropriate quality standards and operational definitions are used.
* **Controlling Quality:** Monitoring specific project results to determine whether they comply with relevant quality standards and identifying ways to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance.
* **Tools and Techniques for Quality Control:**
    * **Statistical Process Control:** Using statistical methods to monitor and control a process to ensure it operates at its full potential.
    * **Six Sigma:** A disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects (driving towards six standard deviations between the mean and the nearest specification limit) in any process.

### üö® Risk Analysis & Management

* **Risk:** An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives.
* **Reactive versus Proactive Risk Strategies:**
    * **Reactive:** Dealing with risks after they occur (firefighting).
    * **Proactive:** Identifying and planning for risks before they occur (preferred approach).
* **Software Risks:** Potential problems that could jeopardize the success of a software project (e.g., technical risks, project risks, business risks).
* **Risk Identification:** Pinpointing potential risks through brainstorming, checklists, interviews.
* **Risk Projection (Assessment):** Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
* **Risk Refinement:** Breaking down high-level risks into more specific, manageable ones.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Developing options and actions to reduce threats to project objectives.
* **Risks Monitoring and Management:** Tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project lifecycle.
* **The RMMM Plan (Risk Management, Monitoring, and Mitigation Plan):** A detailed plan for each identified risk, outlining its description, likelihood, impact, mitigation strategies, contingency plans, and responsible parties. Often developed for case study projects.

### üîÑ Software Configuration Management (SCM)

* **Definition:** A discipline that manages and tracks changes to software artifacts (code, documents, libraries, etc.) throughout the software development lifecycle.
* **The SCM Repository:** A central database or system where all versions of software artifacts are stored and managed.
* **SCM Process:** Involves identification, version control, change control, configuration status accounting, and configuration audits.
* **Version Control and Change Control:**
    * **Version Control:** Systematically managing changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information. (e.g., Git).
    * **Change Control:** A formal process used to ensure that changes to a project's baseline are implemented in a controlled and coordinated manner.
* **SCM Tools:**
    * **GitHub:** A web-based platform for version control using Git, offering collaborative features like pull requests and issue tracking.
    * **Others:** GitLab, Bitbucket, SVN, Perforce.
* **Configuration Management for Web Apps:** Specific considerations for managing configurations (e.g., environment variables, database connections, API keys) in web applications, often using separate configuration files or environment variables.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Maintenance & Reengineering

* **Software Maintenance:** The process of modifying a software system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.
    * **Corrective Maintenance:** Fixing discovered errors/bugs.
    * **Adaptive Maintenance:** Adapting software to a new environment (OS, hardware).
    * **Perfective Maintenance:** Improving functionality, performance, or maintainability.
    * **Preventive Maintenance:** Modifying to prevent future problems.
* **Reengineering:** Re-creating an existing software system from scratch or with significant modifications to improve its quality, maintainability, or functionality, often without changing its external behavior.
* **Business Process Reengineering (BPR):** The fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed. (Broader than just software).

## Unit VI: Leadership and Ethics

### ü§ù Project Leadership

* **Project Leadership:** The ability to guide and motivate a project team to achieve project objectives.
* **Approaches to Leadership:** Different philosophies or frameworks for how leaders operate (e.g., transformational, servant, transactional).
* **Leadership Styles:**
    * **Autocratic:** Leader makes decisions independently.
    * **Democratic/Participative:** Leader involves team in decision-making.
    * **Laissez-Faire:** Leader provides minimal guidance, allowing team to make decisions.
    * **Transformational:** Inspires and motivates teams to achieve higher goals.
    * **Servant Leadership:** Focuses on serving the needs of the team and stakeholders.
* **Emotional Intelligence in Projects:** The ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as perceive and influence the emotions of others. Crucial for effective communication, conflict resolution, and team motivation in project environments.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics in Projects

* **Ethical Leadership:** Leading by example, upholding moral principles, and fostering an ethical environment within the project team and among stakeholders.
* **Common Ethical Dilemmas:** Situations where a project manager or team member faces a choice between two or more conflicting ethical principles or values (e.g., truthfulness vs. protecting privacy, project schedule vs. quality).
* **Making Sound Ethical Decisions:** A systematic approach to ethical decision-making often involves:
    1.  Identifying the ethical issue.
    2.  Gathering facts.
    3.  Evaluating alternative actions.
    4.  Making a decision.
    5.  Acting on the decision.
    6.  Reflecting on the outcome.
* **Codes of Ethics and Professional Practices:** Formal guidelines established by professional organizations (e.g., IEEE, PMI) that outline expected ethical conduct and professional standards for individuals working in the field. These codes provide a framework for ethical decision-making.
