#### üê± V-Model (Verification & Validation in Parallel)

* **Key Principle:** Testing activities are planned and conducted in parallel with development activities.
* **Structure:** Rigid, V-shaped structure, where each development phase on the left side of the 'V' corresponds to a testing phase on the right side.

**Phases:**
* **Left Side (Development/Verification):**
    1.  Requirement Analysis (corresponds to Acceptance Testing)
    2.  System Design (corresponds to System Testing)
    3.  Architecture Design (corresponds to Integration Testing)

6.  **Improve in Next Sprint:** Incorporate feedback and continue development in the next iteration.

* **Benefits:**
    * Customer involved in every step, ensuring alignment.
    * Highly flexible for accommodating changes.
    * Short iterations for quick feedback loops.
    * Better team collaboration.

    * Inspections
    * Checking SRS or Design Documents

#### üß™ Validation (Are we building the right product?)

* **Purpose:** Checks whether the software meets the user's actual needs and expectations.
* **Timing:** Happens *after* development (post-coding).
* **Focus:** The actual product and user requirements.
* **Process:** It is a **dynamic** process (involves execution of code).
* **Examples:**
